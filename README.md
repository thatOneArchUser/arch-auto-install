# arch-auto-install

note: this repository doesn't contain all iso files, it contains only the installer script
note2: i haven't tested bios installation and kde

## Installation
Download the iso from [here](https://mega.nz/file/yAMU2Drb#8oxbzIoKfYjjMwkI_YkEuA7O1_w8zBNP9HzarPwu0Jw)

Just boot it up and run `python /bin/autoinstall.py`

## Issues
You tell me :D
